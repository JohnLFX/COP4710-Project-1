This program was developed using Java 8. Gradle was used to manage the structure of the project. A gradle wrapper is included in the source code for convenience when building the application. In addition, a standalone runnable Jar, 'COP4710-Project-1.jar', is also included so that compilation is not required.

** TO COMPILE **

Navigate to the directory "sources".

On Windows,
Issue the command: gradlew.bat build

On Mac/Linux/UNIX,
Issue the command: ./gradlew build

The target file is located at build/libs/COP4710-Project-1.jar

** TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM **

Issue the command: java -jar COP4710-Project-1.jar
